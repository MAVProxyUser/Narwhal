You could say that this frame is what really brought Team Sasquatch together… in the infinite quest to 'fly like a boss' many of our team members ventured out to learn acrobatics. The task was quite arduous, many arms, and many frames were destroyed in the hunt to become 'Rate Mode Ninjas.' An outside observer may think that we had something against the DJI Flame wheel series, as piles upon piles of broken arms, F350 and F550 frame plates began to accumulate in the Sasquatch lair. 

It is no secret that many of us migrated from DJI based glass fiber, and polyamide nylon centric lifestyle to the more seasoned tastes of a g10 aficionado. In layman’s terms quite simply we collectively got sick of arms flexing mid flight during acrobatics runs, and subsequently breaking after a light crash.

We have all been there! Sometimes all you have to do is look at a DJI arm sideways and it snaps. Enter our initial love for the HoverThings FLIP line of products. They seemed to be nearly impossible to break! None the less, as much fun as we had with the FLIP Sport & FLIP FPV airframes, we were left looking for more. We wanted a hexacopter, and we wanted one nimble enough to flip! For reasons previously mentioned the Flame wheel F550 simply would not do for our team. We wanted a hexachoppa, not a flexachoppa! As such we began our collaboration with HoverThings to design a new bird.

After many months of design scrutiny and crash testing the Narwhal was born. Slightly smaller than the F550, this frame comes in at 470mm and a mere 515 grams. It was designed with the original DJI F550 power train in mind as a one-to-one swap out option. The initial prototypes were tested with DJI 920kv 2212 motors with 8" props and 4S batteries making the frame ripe as a drop in replacement or upgrade for Flame wheel F550 users. The production series was tuned against the T-Motor Anti Gravity Edition 2214 920kv DJI upgraded motor series with 9" props. Our best efforts were made to ensure that our frame maintained compatibility with both the standard DJI power train, and the upgrade set offered by T-Motor for DJI end users. 

Simply put this frame is a beast, she is quick, agile, and her strength remains unmatched by other frames on the market. We are confident that you will enjoy this naughty little frame… she happily awaits your worst bidding! Just looking for a bad ass hexacopter that will take a beating? Give the Narwhal a shot! Team Sasquatch Narwhal Hexas aren't for the feint of heart, but remain a fast way to get started in multi-rotors with quality equipment!
